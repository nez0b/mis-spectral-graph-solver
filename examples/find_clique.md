Below is a concise walk-through of `find_max_clique_with_oracle` and several ideas for making it leaner, faster, and more robust.

────────────────────────────────────────
HOW THE ALGORITHM CURRENTLY WORKS
────────────────────────────────────────
Input:  
• `G` – an (unfrozen) NetworkX graph  
• `oracle` – a black-box function that returns ω(H) for any graph H  

1.  Ask the oracle once on the full graph  
   ```python
   k_target = oracle.get_omega(G)          # The size of a maximum clique
   ```

2.  Initialise  
   ```python
   clique_nodes = ∅
   G_curr       = G.copy()                 # Graph we will shrink
   ```

3.  Process vertices in a fixed order  
   For every vertex `v` still present in `G_curr`  

   a.  Look only at v’s neighbours  
      ```python
      N_v   = G_curr.neighbors(v)
      G_sub = G_curr.subgraph(N_v)         # Induced subgraph on the neighbours
      k_sub = oracle.get_omega(G_sub)      # Size of a max clique inside N(v)
      ```

   b.  Decide whether v belongs to a maximum clique  
      • If `1 + k_sub == k_target`, v **must** appear in *some* maximum clique.  
        Commit to v, restrict the problem to `G_sub`, and decrement the target.  

      • Otherwise v **cannot** be in any maximum clique of size `k_target`;  
        drop it from further consideration.  

   c.  Terminate as soon as `k_target` reaches 0.

4.  Return the set `clique_nodes`.  
   The algorithm performs ≤ |V| oracle calls; each call strictly reduces the
   search space.

In essence, the routine is a “search-to-decision” reduction:  
every oracle call is a yes/no test “Can a clique of the remaining target size
be found if I force v into it?”

────────────────────────────────────────
THINGS THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
────────────────────────────────────────
1.  ⚠️  Frozen-graph bug (now fixed)  
    `G_curr = G_curr.subgraph(N_v)` returns a *view* (frozen).  
    Changing it to `nx.Graph( … )` (or `.copy()`) prevents the runtime error.

2.  Vertex ordering  
   • Current order is `sorted(V)` (essentially arbitrary).  
   • Heuristic orders (highest degree, degeneracy ordering, core numbers) often
     shrink `G_curr` faster, reducing oracle calls.

3.  Early stopping / pruning  
   • If `|G_curr| < k_target` you can abort—no clique that large is possible.  
   • If `max_degree(G_curr) + 1 == k_target`, you know every remaining vertex
     of maximum degree is in some max clique; you can commit en-bloc.

4.  Caching oracle answers  
   The same subgraph can be queried multiple times in dense graphs.  
   A simple dict keyed by frozenset(nodes) saves expensive oracle invocations.

5.  Parallel oracle calls  
   In each iteration you could evaluate several candidate vertices’ neighbourhoods in parallel (if the oracle itself is thread-safe).

6.  Branch-and-bound variant  
   Instead of a deterministic one-pass scan, turn the procedure into a
   depth-first search: choose a pivot v, branch on “include v” vs “exclude v”,
   and use ω-values as bounds.  This can prove optimality with **exponentially**
   fewer oracle calls on many instances.

7.  Cheaper subgraph construction  
   Re-building a NetworkX graph every iteration dominates runtime for large
   graphs.  Keeping an adjacency bit-matrix or edge sets and updating them
   in-place is far cheaper.

8.  Exploit symmetry of returned size  
   If `k_sub == k_target`, v *might* be in a max clique.  
   Calling the oracle on `G_curr − {v}` gives the complementary information
   “Can I reach k_target without v?” and can sometimes eliminate v in one extra
   call instead of iterating later.

9.  Fallback to exact (NetworkX) solver on tiny subproblems  
   When `|G_curr| ≤ 20`, calling `nx.find_cliques` is often faster than
   another expensive oracle optimisation.

────────────────────────────────────────
BOTTOM LINE
────────────────────────────────────────
The algorithm is a clean, textbook search-to-decision reduction that needs only
O(|V|) oracle calls, but:

• Changing one line (`nx.Graph(subgraph)`) fixed the frozen-graph crash.  
• Ordering, pruning, caching, and hybrid branching can drastically cut oracle
  usage and wall-time, especially on denser/larger graphs.
